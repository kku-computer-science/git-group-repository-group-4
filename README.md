1. Go to the XAMPP Download Page: Open your web browser and visit the official XAMPP website at https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html to download the XAMPP installer.
2. Choose and download the XAMPP installer for Windows. Once the download is complete, proceed with the installation.
3. Once the XAMPP installation is complete, navigate to the directory C:\xampp\htdocs to install the system.
4. Go to GitHub to download the ZIP file from the following website:
https://github.com/kku-computer-science/git-group-repository-group-4
Click on "Code" and select "Download ZIP."
5. Then, take the ZIP file you downloaded and move it to C:\xampp\htdocs, and then extract the files there.
6. Next, open Visual Studio Code and open the "Project_1.0" folder that you extracted from the files.
7. Next, open the Terminal in Visual Studio Code and use the command composer install.
8. Next, create a .env file in the root folder and copy the content from the .env.example file into it.
9. Next, install the database by opening XAMPP and going to the MySQL Admin menu. Then, create a new database.

11. Copy the data from the version1_0.sql file and paste it into phpMyAdmin to create the database.
12. Next, go back to the .env file and configure the database connection for the system by setting:
DB_DATABASE to the name of the database you created. DB_USERNAME to root. DB_PASSWORD to leave it empty.
13. Next, generate the application key by going to the Terminal in Visual Studio Code and running the command:php artisan key:generate

Then try to install composer by command again.
